subtitle: Why I'm taking CSCI 103
---
My name is Anna. I'm a prospective music major that mainly takes Div 1 and Div 2 classes. 
In an attempt to stretch myself and simultaneously fulfill my final Div 3 requirement and QFR requirement, I decided to take ETextiles. 

I was drawn to this course because I love making things.

I have made:

- A Stained Glass Tile
- Many Origami boxes
- A Chocolate Cheesecake
- A Knitted Hat
- A Spinning Top

I am very average at making things, but I love it anyway.
