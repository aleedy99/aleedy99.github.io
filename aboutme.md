subtitle: Why I'm taking CS 103
---

I have no programming experience, but I love making things.

I have made:

- A Stained Glass Tile
- Many Origami boxes
- A Chocolate Cheesecake
- A Knitted Hat
- A Spinning Top

I am very average at making things, but I love it anyway. 

## Why am I taking CSCI 103?##
I like making things and my brother suggested that I take a Computer Science course
