This is my completed plushy. It is a stuffed toy that lights up when a button is pressed.

It involved sewing electronic components onto felt and connecting them with conductive thread. The felt was then folded and stuffed and secured with a whip stitch.

This is my plushy in progress

Unfortunately, after testing the circuit with alligator clips I promptly sewed the button, switch, and battery into the plushy and forgot to take a picture of the test.

This is my circuitry prototype.
