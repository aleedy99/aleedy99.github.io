![embroidery sampler](/img/SewingSampler.jpg)

This is my embroidery sampler. 

The two stitches that I chose to do were: 
- The Feather stitch
- The Chain stitch

Some tips that I would give myself:
- Map out the stitch better before doing it. It will look better after
- Keep the fabric flat
- It takes time. Be prepared
