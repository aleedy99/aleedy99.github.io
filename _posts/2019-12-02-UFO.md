### Ultrasonic Felt Opus
The main component of the UFO is the quasi-theremin. 
It uses input from the light sensor and directly reads it out to the buzzer. 
This means that the light can be manipulated to change the pitch of the buzzer, much like how a theremin works. 
The UFO also has a landing light (on board rgb led) activated by the light sensor. 
When the UFO lands the light sensor goes dark and the landing light turns off. 
A switch activates the buzzer (so the music can be turned off with the light still on). 
The other side of the UFO has blue and white lights connected to a battery holder and 2 buttons (one to light up each color). 

I was motivated by wanting to create a theremin. 
Theremins are often heard in Sci-fi music, which made me think about making a theremin that is shaped like a UFO. 
I added the landing light and other lights in order to make it look more like a UFO. 

### Here is a detailed list of materials:

**For the felt pushy part**
- 2 square  9’’ pieces of green felt
- 1 square 9’’ piece of blue felt
- 1 square 9’’(or larger) piece of gray felt
- Green embroidery floss
- Stuffing 

**For the lilypad arduino part (side A)**
- Lilypad Arduino
- Onboard rgb led
- Switch
- Light sensor
- Buzzer
- Battery

**For the battery powered circuitry part (side B)**
- Battery 
- Battery holder
- Button
- Conductive fabric 
- 3 Blue lights
- 3 White lights
  
**For both sides**
- Conductive thread
- Fabric glue

### 3 Tips:
- Take out the battery when you are sewing (so it doesn't short circuit)
- Always check the backside to make sure your sewing is neat (especially when you are sewing with conductive thread)
- Test often so that you can make changes
