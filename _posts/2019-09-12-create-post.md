My name is Anna Leedy. I am a Sophmore and a prospective music major. 

I have absolutely no programming experience and very little sewing experience that involved me sewing Christmas ornaments when I was 7. I hope to learn basic programming and sewing and create something I am proud of.

One boring fact: I never had a TV growing up.
