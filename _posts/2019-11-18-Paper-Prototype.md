### U.F.O - Ultrasonic Felt Opus

Side A of the UFO will have the arduino and its attatchments. 
This side will get the inputs from the switch and light sensor and output the landing light (rgb led) and the music (buzzer).

Side B will be powered by the battery and will turn 2 sets of lights on when the respective button is pressed. 
The diamonds in the image indicate where patching will occur so that the conductive thread does not overlap.
